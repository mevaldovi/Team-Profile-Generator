# Agknowledgments

A special thanks to [Jessamyn McTwigan](https://github.com/jessamyn27) for working closely with me & letting me use her JavaScript for better functionality & CSS layouts.

"Last, but not least, I would like to thank me. I want to thank me for believing in me, I want to thank me for doing all this hard work. I wanna thank me for having no days off. I wanna thank me for never quitting. I wanna thank me for always been a giver and trying to give more than I receive. I want to thank me for trying to do more right than wrong. I want to thank me for just being me at all times.‚Äù --Snoop Dog
